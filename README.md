## About Me

Hi there, I’m Álvaro
I’m 21 and currently work as a Data Analyst at Sportradar, validating real-time data and collaborating with international teams.

I studied two years of a Computer Science degree at ORT University and recently started Computer Engineering at UDELAR, aiming for a path more aligned with my long-term goal in technology.

I have initial experience in Python, Java, C#, and JavaScript, gained both through university and self-learning. I’m proactive, curious, and highly motivated to keep growing.

What excites me most is the chance to work in an international and challenging environment where I can contribute while developing my skills and passion for tech.

In addition, I’m currently working on a personal long-term project: building my own AI assistant, Lyra and setting up my own NAS server, combining my interests in software, infrastructure, and innovation.
